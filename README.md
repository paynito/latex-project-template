# latex-project-template

Management of latex template files.
latex-project-template creates a latex project directory from a template
in ~/.latex\_project\_template.
The directory is git repository and includes Rakefile to compile
a latex file with latexmk.

- <http://rubygems.org/gems/latex-project-template>
- <https://github.com/ytaka/latex-project-template>

## Requirements

latex-project-template uses latexmk to compile latex files and
the project directory is managed by git.

- [latexmk](http://www.phys.psu.edu/~collins/software/latexmk-jcc/)
- [Git](http://git-scm.com/)
- some LaTeX environment

latex-project-template depends on the following gems.

- git
- filename
- user_config

## Install

We can install by rubygems.

    gem install latex-project-template

## Usage

If we install latex-project-template, we can use the command 'latex-project-template'.
First of all, we create configuration directory ~/.latex\_project\_template.

    latex-project-template --init

Next, we edit template files in ~/.latex\_project\_template.
If we want to create latex project 'new_project' fromo 'default' template, type

    latex-project-template new_project

If we want to create from other template (for example, 'japanese'),
we type next command.

    latex-project-template new_project japanese

To list templates in ~/.latex\_project\_template, we type

    latex-project-template --list

\_\_PROJECT\_\_

- Check out the latest master to make sure the feature hasn't been implemented or the bug hasn't been fixed yet

- Fork the project
- Start a feature/bugfix branch
- Commit and push until you are happy with your contribution
- Make sure to add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a future version unintentionally.
- Please try not to mess with the Rakefile, version, or history. If you want to have your own version, or is otherwise necessary, that is fine, but please isolate to its own commit so I can cherry-pick around it.
